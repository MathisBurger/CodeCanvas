# Tasky

Tasky handles all activities and events regarding groups, assignments and solutions.


## Testing coverage

The aim of our tests is to ensure the end-to-end functionality of the microservice. Therefore, we do not test the repositories and other activities.
We only test seperate modules like the security and the whole endpoint functionality. Through this methodology we ensure the functionality of out application
end to end without the effort of testing each individual component like the models or mongoDB.
